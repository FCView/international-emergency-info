How to call for an emergency

        *   press & hold the side button and one of the volume buttons.
    *   **iPhone 7 and lower:** 
        *   rapidly press the side (or top) button 5 times.

    *   **Android 11 and lower:**

    *   **Primary:** 
        *   In nearly all countries, you can use your device's **Emergency SOS** feature (see Apple and Android sections above).
    *   **Secondary:** 
        *   In nearly all countries, you can just dial 911 from your US or Canadian cell phone, and the system will attempt to re-route the call to local emergency services. (this may not always work)
    *   **Backups:** 
        *   Contact your hotel's front desk.
        *   Try connecting to wifi for Wifi Calling.
