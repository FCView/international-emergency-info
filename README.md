# International Emergency Info

Local emergency services phone numbers and US and Canadian Embassy info for each country.

This data was collected from either the US Embassy website, or the Canadian Embassy website. In cases of discrepancies, further searching for local news articles and other public sources of data (eg - local government websites) were used to determine current info. In some cases, local residents were used to confirm the emergency services phone numbers.

# How to call for an emergency from your cell phone

### Emergency SOS

In nearly all cases, you can use your device's **Emergency SOS** feature:

### Apple ([Use Emergency SOS on your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208076))

This works on all Apple iPhones:

- **iPhone 8 or later:** press & hold the side button and one of the volume buttons.

- **iPhone 7 or earlier:** rapidly press the side (or top) button 5 times.

- **Via Satellite (iPhone 14 or later):** [Use Emergency SOS via satellite on your iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213426)

### Android ([Get help during an emergency with your Android phone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208076](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9319337)))

- **Android 12 or later:** rapidly press the power button 5 times or more.

- **Android 11 and earlier:** Emergency SOS is not available. The local emergency services number must be dialed, but in a lot of cases, dialing 911 should still trigger the phone to make a general "emergency" call that will be interpreted by the cell tower they connect to.
